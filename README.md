This repository contains the **embedded C++ code** (Arduino framework) for the *Development of a smart blind stick for enhanced mobility and safety for visually impaired person* as part of Smart India Hackathon'25 (SIH'25).
The code is designed to run on an **ESP32** microcontroller and integrates:
Dual *IR sensors* for ground-level detection (potholes/stairs)
Three *Ultrasonic sensors* for head-level/mid-level obstacle detection
*ESP32-CAM* for visual feedback on obstacle detection
*Buzzer/Vibration Motor* for alert feedback
*FreeRTOS tasks* for real-time parallel execution
